# Control the Unreal Editor

In this example application, we demonstrate how to control the Unreal Editor and a play-in-editor simulation using a single `spear.Instance` object. You can run this example as follows.

```console
python run.py
```

You should see the Unreal Editor open, then a play-in-editor simulation will be launched, then the play-in-editor simulation will be closed, then screenshot will be saved to this directory.
