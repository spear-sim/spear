# Control a Simple Agent

In this example application, we demonstrate how to control a simple sphere agent and obtain egocentric visual observations. You can run this example as follows.

```console
python run.py
```

You should see a game window appear, as well as an OpenCV window that shows egocentric visual observations from the agent. To advance the simulation, press any key while the OpenCV window is in focus.
