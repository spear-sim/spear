# NumPy Interoperability

In this example application, we demonstrate how to efficiently pass NumPy arrays to and from Unreal game entities.

Before running this example, rename `user_config.yaml.example` to `user_config.yaml` and modify the contents appropriately for your system, as described in our [Getting Started](../../docs/getting_started.md) tutorial. Your `user_config.yaml` file only needs to specify the value of a parameter if it differs from the defaults defined in the `python/spear/config` directory. You can browse this directory for a complete set of all user-configurable parameters.

### Running the example

You can run this example as follows.

```console
python run.py
```

You should see a game window appear, with the contents of several NumPy arrays printed to the console.
