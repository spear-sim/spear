# NumPy Interoperability

In this example application, we demonstrate how to efficiently pass NumPy arrays to and from Unreal game entities. You can run this example as follows.

```console
python run.py
```

You should see a game window appear, with some debug output printed to the console showing NumPy arrays passing back and forth from from Unreal game entities.
