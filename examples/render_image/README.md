# Render an Image

In this example application, we demonstrate how to spawn a camera sensor object and use it to render images. You can run this example as follows.

```console
python run.py
```

You should see a game window appear, as well as an OpenCV window that matches what you see in the game window. You can close the OpenCV window by pressing any key while it is in focus.
