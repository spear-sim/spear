# Getting Started

In this example application, we demonstrate how to spawn a simple object and access some of the object's properties. You can run this example as follows.

```console
python run.py
```

You should see a game window appear, with a set of coordinate axes appearing immediately in the scene. Additionally, you should see several object properties printed to the console.
