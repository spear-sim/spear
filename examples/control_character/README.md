# Control the Default Unreal Humanoid Character

In this example application, we demonstrate how to control the default Unreal humanoid character. You can run this example as follows.

```console
# control character using high-level actions and record joint poses to a CSV file
python run.py

# replay character motion by directly setting joint poses
python replay.py
```

When running `run.py`, you should see a game window appear and two default Unreal humanoid characters running and jumping. When running `replay.py`, you should see the same character motion.
