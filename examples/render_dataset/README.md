# Render Dataset

In this example application, we demonstrate how to demonstrates how to generate random camera poses and render a collection of images. You can run this example as follows.

```console
# generate camera poses
python generate_camera_poses.py

# render images
python run.py
```

Running `generate_camera_poses.py` will generate a CSV file containing camera poses, and running `run.py` will render an image for each camera pose.
