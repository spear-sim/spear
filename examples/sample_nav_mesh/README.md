# Sample Nav Mesh

In this example application, we demonstrate how to sample points and shortest paths from Unreal's nav mesh system.. You can run this example as follows.

```console
python run.py
```

You should see a game window appear, and axes spawning at random locations in the walkable space in the default apartment scene.
