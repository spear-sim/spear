# Render Hypersim Images

In this example application, we demonstrate how to spawn a camera sensor object and use it to render images that match the Hypersim dataset. You can run this example as follows.

```console
python run.py
```

You should see a game window appear, and a collection of images should be written to an `images` subdirectory in this directory.
