# Render an Image (in the Unreal Editor)

In this example editor script, we demonstrate how to how to render an image. If you're working in the Unreal Editor, you can run this script from the editor's Python console as follows. See [here](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/scripting-the-unreal-editor-using-python) for details.

```console
/absolute/path/to/spear/examples/render_image_editor/run.py
```

Alternatively, you can run this script from the command-line as follows.

```console
python ../../tools/run_editor_script.py --script /absolute/path/to/spear/examples/render_image_editor/run.py --unreal-engine-dir path/to/UE_5.5 --launch-mode full --render-offscreen
```

After running this script, you should see an image saved in the same directory as this `README` file.
