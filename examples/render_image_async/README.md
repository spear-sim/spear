# Render an Image (Using the Asynchronous API)

In this example application, we demonstrate how to render images using the asynchronous API available in SPEAR. You can run this example as follows.

```console
python run.py

# run in benchmarking mode (optional)
python run.py --benchmark
```

You should see a game window appear, as well as an OpenCV window that matches what you see in the game window. You can close the OpenCV window by pressing any key while it is in focus. If you run in benchmarking mode, you'll see some timing results printed to the terminal.
