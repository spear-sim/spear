; This custom configuration file is inserted into public release builds by
; spear/tools/build_executable/build_executable.py. This file's original location in
; the SPEAR codebase is spear/tools/build_executable. We insert this file into public
; release builds in order to modify the default map. Doing so enables a user to
; double-click on a SpearSim executable and navigate around our Kujiale test scene
; without requiring any further configuration. We choose not to set the Kujiale scene
; as our default scene in any other builds because it takes a long time to load, and
; is not useful during routine development.
