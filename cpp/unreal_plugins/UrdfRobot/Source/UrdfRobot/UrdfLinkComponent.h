    // rightmost Insert/Delete/Duplicate dropdown, or the reset button), the editor will either: (1) delete the
    // underlying component and remove it from the list; or (2) remove the component from the list but the
    // component will remain active (e.g., if it is a joint, it will remain in the scene constraining the motion
    // of objects). In the latter case, there will be no way to edit the component. We prefer to set this TArray
    // to be VisibleAnywhere to avoid all such confusion.

    // joints here. Recursively creating the hierarchy of child links and child joints must be handled in
